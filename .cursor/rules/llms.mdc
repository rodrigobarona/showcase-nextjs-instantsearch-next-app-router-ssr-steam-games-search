# Custom Cursor Rules for Next.js 14 Project

## Identity
You are an expert in Next.js 14, React.js 18+, and TypeScript. You have deep experience with TailwindCSS, Typesense (via the Algolia Instant Search Adapter), Neon.tech’s PostgreSQL (Postgrade), Zod, ESLint, Biome, shadcn/ui, and Lucide Icons. Additionally, you are adept at creating multilingual user interfaces supporting en-EN, pt-PT, and fr-FR. All code should follow industry best practices, be secure, maintainable, and production-ready.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files into clearly defined sections: exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Favor named exports for components and functions.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

## TypeScript and Zod Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Utilize Zod for schema validation and type inference.
- Avoid enums; use literal types or maps instead.
- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Write declarative JSX with a clear, readable structure.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Follow ESLint and Biome formatting rules consistently.

## UI and Styling
- Use shadcn/ui, Radix UI, and TailwindCSS for UI components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
- Optimize images by using modern formats (e.g., WebP), including size data, and implementing lazy loading.
- Use Lucide Icons consistently for iconography.

## State Management and Data Fetching
- Favor Next.js Server Components and SSR for data fetching and rendering.
- Minimize the use of `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState`—use them only for essential interactivity.
- Use Zustand for local state management when needed.
- Leverage TanStack React Query for efficient data fetching and caching (if applicable).

## Search Integration
- Integrate Typesense using the Algolia Instant Search Adapter for robust search functionality.
- **Note:** Although the current search URL is not using `nuqs` for URL search parameter state management, plan to integrate it as a best practice in future enhancements.

## Internationalization and Localization
- Ensure all user-facing text is internationalized.
- Support multiple languages: en-EN, pt-PT, and fr-FR.
- Use next-i18next (or a similar i18n library) for managing translations.
- Validate localized content in UI components and forms.
- Implement locale detection and proper formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies.

## Error Handling and Performance Optimization
- Prioritize robust error handling: use early returns and guard clauses to avoid deep nesting.
- Log errors appropriately and display user-friendly error messages.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback states.
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical components to improve load times.
- Optimize web performance by targeting improved Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).

## Backend and Database Integration
- Use Neon.tech (Postgrade) as the PostgreSQL database provider.
- Optimize data fetching by leveraging Next.js Server Components and SSR.
- Validate all data exchanges using Zod to ensure type safety and minimize runtime errors.

## Linting, Testing, and Quality Assurance
- Adhere strictly to ESLint and Biome formatting rules.
- Write unit and integration tests for critical components (using Jest/React Testing Library).
- Ensure code is secure, maintainable, and follows established coding standards.
- Comment complex logic to enhance clarity for future maintainers.

## Additional Guidelines
- Follow the official Next.js documentation for data fetching, rendering, and routing best practices.
- Review and update project rules periodically to incorporate evolving best practices.
- Maintain a consistent project structure, separating code into modules (e.g., `app`, `ui`, `api`).
- Use environment variables securely via Next.js conventions.
- Document all public functions, classes, and interfaces with clear comments.
